# Learning GLSL

This is an overview of my learning experience so far with learning about fragment shaders from complete 0...

Gallery of shaders made so far: https://merryvj.github.io/shader-gallery/

### Phase 0: What is a shader?
At this point I didn’t know how GPUs worked and what shaders could even be used for. I just dimly knew they could be incorporated in some sort of audiovisual performance setup. Visual explanations like these were helpful:


* [Shaders explained by a designer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-GYBUANXXc&ab_channel=ComputingforDesigners) 
* Playing with [Hydra]( https://hydra.ojack.xyz/), an accessible coding environment that abstracts GLSL into easily understandable functions


### Phase 1: How to think in shader logic?
Now that I know what shaders can do, how do I just draw something just like *that*? This is when tutorials that go over how techniques work together were useful:

* [A basic overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifChJ0nJfM&ab_channel=InigoQuilez) by Inigo Quilez (legend) - this is where it all started to click for me
* “Shadertoy” live coding walkthroughs by the [Art of Code](https://www.youtube.com/@TheArtofCodeIsCool/videos) youtube channel


### Phase 2: Which shader techniques to use?
This is when resources like [BookOfShaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) started being useful. It’s like learning how the different tools in Photoshop work, and building a repertoire! I now had a ["stickersheet"](https://github.com/merryvj/shader-gallery/blob/main/shaders/utils.frag) of functions I knew how to use and showcased my first 20 shaders [here](https://merryvj.github.io/shader-gallery/).


### Phase 3: 3D time? Also pipelines...?
This is where I'm currently at, and feel like I've hit a wall scavenging for resources on scattered blogs (mainly [Inigo Quilez](https://iquilezles.org/)). I've also begun incorporating shaders into other [projects](https://github.com/merryvj/movingsoup) and testing the workflows (e.g. quite straightfoward for [p5.js](https://itp-xstory.github.io/p5js-shaders/#/))
